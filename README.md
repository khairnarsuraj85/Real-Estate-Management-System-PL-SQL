## Project Description  
The Real Estate Management System is a database-driven project designed to manage properties, clients, agents, and transactions efficiently. The system ensures seamless tracking of property availability, calculates agent commissions, and provides insights into transactions.

The project utilizes SQL and PL/SQL to handle database operations, ensuring data accuracy, integrity, and consistency.

## Features  

### **Property Management**  
- Allows users to search properties based on filters like location, price range, and availability.  
- Automatically updates property availability after transactions.  

### **Client and Agent Management**  
- Maintains detailed records of clients and agents for better transaction handling.  

### **Agent Commission Calculation**  
- Implements PL/SQL procedures to calculate agent commissions based on completed sales.  

### **Triggers for Property Updates**  
- Uses database triggers to automatically update property availability after a sale.  

### **Transaction Insights**  
- Tracks all property transactions for efficient reporting and decision-making.

## Key Database Tasks  

- **Search Properties Based on Filters:**  
  SQL queries to search properties by location, price, and availability.  

- **Agent Commission Calculation:**  
  PL/SQL procedures to compute commissions for agents based on sales.  

- **Update Property Availability:**  
  Triggers to ensure property status is updated automatically post-sale.  

- **Transaction Reports:**  
  SQL queries to provide insights into completed transactions and property trends.

## How to Run the System  

1. **Set up the Database:**  
   Create an Oracle Database instance with the required schema and tables.  

2. **Load SQL Scripts:**  
   Run the provided SQL scripts to create triggers, stored procedures, and functions.  

3. **Execute Queries:**  
   Use a SQL client to test features such as booking properties, managing clients and agents, and generating reports.  

4. **Test Functionalities:**  
   Validate the system by executing test queries for searching properties, calculating agent commissions, and updating property availability.
